# Hi there 👋

My name is Daragh I'm a post graduate from UCC having studied a level 8 in Applied Computing Technology. I'm doing some travelling now that I've finished my education but I'm still working away on improving previous projects and developing new ones!

Things I enjoy other than coding:

🎸 playing guitar (electric & acoustic)

🎿 skiing and snowboarding

🏋️‍♂️ olympic weightlifting

I've really enjoyed Web Development and Python. I also plan to venture into the lower level languages in due time.
